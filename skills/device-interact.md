# Device Interact Skill

Interact with running iOS simulators and Android emulators/devices: tap, swipe, pinch to zoom (Android emulator only — iOS in progress), type text, press buttons, and navigate the app UI.

## When to Trigger

Use this skill when the task involves:
- Tapping buttons, links, or UI elements on the device
- Swiping or scrolling through content
- Typing text into input fields
- Pressing hardware buttons (Home, Back, etc.)
- Navigating through the app by interacting with the UI
- Automating a sequence of user interactions for testing
- Verifying UI behavior after code changes
- Reproducing a user-reported bug through specific interaction steps

## Instructions

### 1. Discover Available Devices

First, check what devices are running:
- Use `mcp__execbro__list_devices` to find iOS simulators, Android emulators, and physical devices in one call

### 2. See What's on Screen

Before interacting, understand the current screen:

**Screenshot approach (recommended first step):**
- Use `mcp__execbro__ios_screenshot` or `mcp__execbro__android_screenshot` for visual reference

**Component tree approach (for finding React Native elements without screenshots):**
- Use `mcp__execbro__get_screen_state` — the fastest orientation pass. Returns the active route + navigation stack, groups elements behind an open overlay or raised keyboard (taps will NOT reach those until it closes), and lists every on-screen element — pressables (component tag, label, testID, onPress hint), text, images — each with a tap-ready `(x, y)` centre and frame. Pass `pressablesOnly=true` for just the tappable list
- Use `mcp__execbro__get_screen_layout` for an indented tree of visible components with positions, text, and identifiers
- Use `mcp__execbro__find_components` to regex-search the fiber tree for a specific component by name

### 3. Tap Elements

**Use the unified `tap` tool for all tapping — it auto-detects the platform and tries multiple strategies automatically:**

- `mcp__execbro__tap` — single cross-platform tool with automatic fallback chain:
  1. Fiber tree (direct `onPress` invocation)
  2. Accessibility tree (native element matching)
  3. OCR (visual text recognition)
  4. Error with actionable suggestion

**By visible text:**
```
tap(text="Login")          # case-insensitive substring match
tap(text="Submit")
```

**By testID prop:**
```
tap(testID="login-btn")    # exact match
```

**By React component name:**
```
tap(component="MenuIcon")  # case-insensitive substring match
```

**By coordinates (from a screenshot, `get_screen_state`, or `get_screen_layout`):**
```
tap(x=300, y=600)                          # same coordinate system as every layout tool — pass it through unchanged
tap(x=300, y=600, device="emulator-5554")  # pin the device when both platforms are connected
```

**Native mode (no React Native connection needed):**
```
tap(x=300, y=600, native=true)                          # taps directly via ADB/simctl
tap(x=300, y=600, native=true, device="emulator-5554")  # pin the device
```
Use `native=true` when tapping system dialogs, non-RN apps, or before establishing a React Native connection. Requires x/y coordinates. The platform is inferred from the resolved device.

**Long press (hold the touch instead of releasing it):**
```
tap(testID="row-3", duration=800)     # context menus, drag starts, multi-select
tap(x=300, y=600, duration=1500)      # coordinates work too, on either platform
```
React Native fires `onLongPress` at 500ms, so anything under 500 will not trigger it; 800 is a safe default. The response carries `longPress.handlerFound`:

- `true` — the element really has an `onLongPress` handler (only the fiber strategy can see this)
- `false` — the hold was delivered, but this element has none, so RN fired its `onPress` on release instead. The call still succeeds; the warning tells you the long-press action is not wired here
- `null` — resolved via accessibility, OCR or coordinates, which cannot see handlers. Not "no handler", just not knowable from that strategy

An element wired **only** for long press (`onLongPress` with no `onPress`) is invisible to an ordinary `tap` by design, since a short press on it does nothing. Passing `duration` is what makes it resolvable. `android_long_press` remains for Android coordinate holds with no RN connection.

**Switches and checkboxes.** A `Switch` has no `onPress` — its state is a `value` prop — so reaching one used to mean guessing an x off a screenshot and pairing it with the row label's y, which lands on the neighbouring row about as often as not. Target it like anything else:

```
tap(testID="notifications-switch")
tap(component="Switch", index=2)      # get_screen_state lists them in order, with values
```

The response carries `switch.before` / `switch.after` / `switch.changed`, read back from the element after the gesture. Read it: a pixel diff reports `meaningful:true` with the same tiny change rate whether you flipped the right row or the wrong one, so the value is the only thing that tells those apart. `changed:false` means the gesture landed and the value did not move — disabled, controlled-and-rejected, or a miss.

**Pin to a specific device when multiple are connected:**
```
tap(text="Submit", device="iPhone SE")        # simulator/emulator or RN app name (substring)
tap(text="Submit", device="ABC-123-...")      # an iOS UDID or adb serial works too
```
`tap` takes a single `device` param — there is no separate `udid` or `platform` argument. It accepts an iOS simulator UDID, an Android adb serial (`emulator-5554`), a simulator/emulator name, or a connected RN app's deviceName, all by substring match, and mirrors `device` on `get_screen_layout`/`swipe`. Omit it when exactly one device is available; without it on a multi-device session the tap can land on the wrong simulator. Call `list_devices` to enumerate.

**Force a specific strategy:**
```
tap(text="Settings", strategy="ocr")           # skip fiber/accessibility
tap(text="Submit", strategy="accessibility")   # skip fiber
```

**Multiple matches — use index:**
```
tap(text="Button", index=2)   # tap the 3rd match (0-based)
```

**Control screenshots and verification:**
```
tap(text="Submit", screenshot=false)       # skip post-tap screenshot for faster execution
tap(x=300, y=600, verify=true)             # before/after diff to confirm tap had visual effect
tap(text="Login", verify=false)            # skip verification (default for fiber strategy)
```
`screenshot` (default: true) controls whether a post-tap screenshot is returned. `verify` (default: true for coordinate/accessibility/ocr, false for fiber) runs a before/after screenshot diff to detect if the tap caused a meaningful visual change.

**Deeply wrapped components — increase traversal depth:**
```
tap(component="CartIcon", maxTraversalDepth=25)   # default is 15
```
Use `maxTraversalDepth` when `tap(component=...)` fails because the component is deeply wrapped in HOCs or animation wrappers.

**On failure**, the response includes a `suggestion` field telling you exactly what to try next. Follow it.

**Non-ASCII text** (Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic): `tap` automatically skips fiber (Hermes limitation) and uses accessibility/OCR. For best results, use `testID` or `component` params instead.

**Icon-only buttons** (no text label): Use `tap(component="ComponentName")`. Use `find_components` first to discover component names. If that fails, use screenshot coordinates: `tap(x=..., y=...)`.

### 4. Other Interactions

**Long press** — `mcp__execbro__tap` with `duration` (both platforms). See the Long press section above. `mcp__execbro__android_long_press` remains for Android coordinate holds with no React Native connection.

**Swipe/scroll** — `mcp__execbro__swipe`, cross-platform:
- `swipe(direction="up")` scrolls to reveal content below; `"down"`/`"left"`/`"right"` also work, and a bare `swipe()` defaults to `"up"`
- `distance` is in screenshot pixels (default 33% of the axis); pass all four of `startX`/`startY`/`endX`/`endY` for a coordinate-precise gesture, which takes precedence over `direction`
- Read `verification.meaningful`. When false, `warning` names which no-op it was — already at top, already at end, not scrollable, wrong axis, no scroll view under the start point, or (with no RN connection) that it could not inspect the screen
- `burst:true` catches overscroll/bounce that settles before the after-frame; `verify:false, screenshot:false` is the fastest path
- It drives the device through adb/simctl, so it works on non-RN screens too — only the no-op diagnosis needs a React Native connection

**Pinch to zoom** — `mcp__execbro__pinch`. **Android emulator only; iOS in progress.**
- `pinch(direction="out")` zooms in at screen centre, `direction="in"` zooms out
- `pinch(direction="out", x=..., y=...)` pivots the zoom on a point (screenshot pixels — the same space as `tap`)
- `scale` is the finger-separation ratio; values too large for one gesture chain automatically
- `angle=90` puts the fingers on the vertical axis
- Read `verification.meaningful` exactly as with `swipe`
- `span` is how much of the screen the gesture occupies — 1 by default for `"out"`, 0.5 for `"in"`, because a pinch-in starts with the fingers far apart and a full span would land them on a top bar or bottom sheet. Lower it further if a gesture still lands on surrounding UI
- It sends real kernel touch events, so it drives native views, WebViews, and maps — not only React Native. Physical Android devices and iOS return an explicit error rather than a partial result

**Type text** — `mcp__execbro__input_text`, cross-platform:
- Give it a `testID` and it focuses the field itself, types, then reads the value back and compares it, so a silent miss is reported rather than assumed
- `replace:true` clears a pre-filled field first (Bridgeless/Fabric). It APPENDs by default, which is the usual cause of `https://demo.example.comhttps://app.example.com`
- `mcp__execbro__dismiss_keyboard` blurs the focused input when the keyboard covers what you need next
- `native:true` skips React targeting and types into whatever the OS reports as focused — system dialogs, non-RN screens; tap the field first. Ignores `testID`/`component`/`textMatch`. Auto-applied when no fiber tree is reachable at all, even without the flag
- A masked field (`secureTextEntry`) exposes bullets, not text, so the write is reported as delivered but NOT verified. That is the ceiling, not a bug
- Differences the FIELD introduced — `autoCapitalize` turning `abc` into `Abc`, autocorrect respacing, a display mask — count as verified, not as a failed write. A `maxLength` truncation is named as the cause instead of retried
- `keyboardType`: both write paths bypass the on-screen keyboard, so letters land in a `number-pad` field. Allowed, and noted in the response

**Hardware buttons:**
- iOS: `mcp__execbro__ios_button` (HOME, LOCK, SIDE_BUTTON, SIRI, APPLE_PAY)
- Android: `mcp__execbro__android_key_event` (HOME, BACK, ENTER, DEL, MENU, etc.)

**Deep links:**
- iOS: `mcp__execbro__ios_open_url` with the full URL (e.g., `myapp://settings/profile` or `https://example.com`)

### 5. Get Screen Dimensions (when needed for coordinates)

When calculating swipe distances or tap positions on an unfamiliar device:
- Android: `mcp__execbro__android_screenshot` reports the device's pixel resolution (`originalWidth` / `originalHeight`)
- Use this before computing percentage-based coordinates (e.g., center = width/2, height/2)
- For iOS simulators, the resolution is part of the simulator spec — use `list_devices` to identify the device model

### 6. Wait for UI Updates

After navigation or interactions that change the screen, poll the UI by re-calling
`mcp__execbro__get_screen_state` in a short retry loop until the expected route or
element shows up. It is the best poll — screenshot-free, shows the active route, and
flags an overlay or keyboard that would swallow the next tap. Fall back to
`get_screen_layout` (or `find_components`) when you need the full component tree.

### 7. Verify Results

After interactions, verify the result:
- Call `mcp__execbro__get_screen_state` to confirm the expected route and on-screen elements
- Take a screenshot to confirm the expected screen
- Check logs for any errors triggered by the interaction

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Optional: describe the interaction to perform (e.g., "tap Settings button", "scroll down", "type hello in search")

## Usage Examples

- `/device-interact` - Show available devices and current screen content
- `/device-interact "tap the Settings button"` - Find and tap the Settings button
- `/device-interact "scroll down on the main screen"` - Perform a swipe-up gesture
- `/device-interact "type test@email.com in the email field"` - Tap email field and type text
- `/device-interact "open myapp://profile/123"` - Open a deep link in the iOS simulator
- `/device-interact "get screen size"` - Get the Android device's pixel resolution

## MCP Tools Used

- `mcp__execbro__tap`
- `mcp__execbro__find_components`
- `mcp__execbro__list_devices`
- `mcp__execbro__ios_screenshot` / `android_screenshot`
- `mcp__execbro__get_screen_state`
- `mcp__execbro__get_screen_layout`
- `mcp__execbro__inspect_at_point`
- `mcp__execbro__swipe` / `mcp__execbro__pinch`
- `mcp__execbro__input_text` / `mcp__execbro__dismiss_keyboard`
- `mcp__execbro__android_long_press` (no-RN coordinate holds)
- `mcp__execbro__ios_button` / `android_key_event`
- `mcp__execbro__ios_open_url`

## Notes

- Requires the ExecBro MCP server to be running
- iOS simulator interactions require IDB (`brew install idb-companion`) or AXe CLI (`brew install cameroncooke/axe/axe`). Set `IOS_DRIVER=axe` env var to use AXe.
- **Always use `tap` for tapping** — it handles platform detection, device resolution, and fallback strategies automatically. Use `native=true` for system UI or non-RN apps
- All layout tools share one screen-space coordinate system — `get_screen_state`, `get_screen_layout`, `measure`, `inspect_at_point`, screenshots and `tap` speak the same coordinates. Pass a coordinate from any of them to any other unchanged; there is no pixel→point conversion to do.
- On failure, follow the `suggestion` field in the tap response — it tells you exactly what to try next
- Poll with `get_screen_state` after navigation to ensure the next screen is ready before interacting — it also tells you whether an overlay or the keyboard is blocking your target
- For Android, the Back button is available via `android_key_event` with key "BACK"
- `ios_open_url` works for both custom scheme deep links (`myapp://`) and universal links (`https://`)
- Read the resolution from `android_screenshot` before computing swipe coordinates on physical devices where screen resolution varies
- **MCP server alias note:** examples use the alias `execbro` (tools prefixed `mcp__execbro__`). If you previously registered the server with the older alias `rn-ai-devtools`, substitute `mcp__rn-ai-devtools__` in these examples — both work, only the alias differs.
