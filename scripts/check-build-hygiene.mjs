/**
 * Fails the build when the published output mentions a third-party product.
 *
 * `files` ships build/, so anything in src/ reaches the npm tarball — including
 * internal notes. `removeComments` is NOT sufficient on its own: much of this
 * codebase builds injected JS inside template literals, and TypeScript passes
 * string content through verbatim, comments and all. A note written inside one
 * of those strings ships no matter what the compiler options say.
 *
 * This script checks the emitted output instead of the source, so it catches
 * every route in: real comments, injected-source comments, string literals and
 * tool descriptions alike.
 *
 * Lives in scripts/ deliberately — that directory is not published, so the
 * denylist itself never ships.
 *
 * The denylist terms live in scripts/build-hygiene-denylist.json, which is
 * gitignored: naming a specific competitor in a public repo is itself a tell
 * that their product was inspected closely enough to worry about. See
 * scripts/build-hygiene-denylist.example.json for the shape.
