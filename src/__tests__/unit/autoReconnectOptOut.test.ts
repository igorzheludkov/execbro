/**
 * `executeInApp`'s outer scan-and-retry block used to run on every transport
 * failure, ignoring `options.autoReconnect` entirely — only the inner loop read
 * it. Background callers that explicitly asked for one attempt got an endless
 * reconnect storm instead: in one production week, 2192 of 2233
 * `_auto_reconnect` failures came from the SDK mirror poller, 2093 of them from
 * a single install polling a dead simulator overnight.
 *
 * The reconnect attempt is observed through `scanMetroPorts` — the first thing
 * `attemptQuickReconnect` calls. Mocking metro.js is also what keeps this test
 * off the developer's real localhost ports, which is why it does not drive the
 * real socket path.
