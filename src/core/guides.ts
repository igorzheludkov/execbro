        summary: "Connect to a running React Native app via Metro bundler",
        content: `# Session Setup

## Prerequisites (CRITICAL — install BEFORE using device tools)
- **iOS UI driver (required for tap, ios_button, and all iOS interaction tools):**
  - Default: AXe — brew install cameroncooke/axe/axe
  - Alternative: IDB — brew install idb-companion (set IOS_DRIVER=idb in MCP server env to use it)
  - Without a UI driver, most iOS tools will fail with "not installed" errors
- **Android:** ADB must be in PATH (comes with Android SDK Platform Tools)

## Quick Start
1. scan_metro — auto-discovers Metro on ports 8081-8090 and connects. Note: this occupies the CDP slot, which prevents the built-in React Native debugger from connecting. See "Switch to Native Debugger" below.
2. get_apps — verify the app appears in connected list
3. get_connection_status — check connection health

## If No App Running
- list_devices — iOS simulators, Android emulators, and physical devices in one call
- ios_boot_simulator — boot an iOS simulator if needed
- ios_launch_app / android_launch_app — launch the app
- Wait 2-3 seconds, then scan_metro

## Switch to Native Debugger
- disconnect_metro — closes all CDP connections and stops auto-reconnect
- The built-in React Native debugger can now connect
- Use scan_metro to reconnect when done with native debugger

## Key Tools
- scan_metro: auto-discover and connect (preferred)
- connect_metro: connect to specific port (when you know it)
- disconnect_metro: close all connections (free CDP slot for native debugger)
- ensure_connection: health check with healthCheck=true
- get_connection_status: check uptime and gaps`

        title: "Component Inspection",
        summary: "Identify which React component renders a UI element, get hierarchy and file paths",
        content: `# Component Inspection

## Recommended Workflow: Identify a Component on Screen
1. Take a screenshot (ios_screenshot / android_screenshot) or use ocr_screenshot
2. Identify the target element visually, estimate its coordinates
3. Pass those coordinates straight through — every layout tool, tap() and the screenshots share one screen-space coordinate system, so no conversion is needed
4. Pick the right tool (see decision below) and call it with (x, y)

### inspect_at_point(x, y)
The tool for "what is at (x, y)?". Pure fiber-tree hit test via measureInWindow —
NO overlay, zero visual side effect, safe to call rapidly or across a transition.

Returns:
- element name and full owner-tree path
- FRAME PER ANCESTOR (position/size in dp for every ancestor that hit-tested the point)
- PROPS of the innermost component (handlers as [Function], refs, testID, custom props)
- the node's own style object
- source {file, line, column} plus the owner chain as "Source ancestors" (set source=false to skip in tight loops)

| Question you're asking | How it answers |
|---|---|
| "Why is this hit area so small?" / "Where exactly is each ancestor?" | FRAME PER ANCESTOR |
| "What handler is wired to this Pressable?" / "What testID does it have?" | full PROPS |
| "Which file owns this component?" | source + Source ancestors |
| "What padding/borderRadius is set here?" | the node's own style object |

Note: style is the node's own style object, not RN's merged cascade. When a value
looks wrong and isn't on the node itself, walk the ancestors it returns.

### Other inspection tools
- find_components(pattern) — regex search by component name across the fiber tree.
- get_component_tree — compact names-only structure by default; pass structureOnly=false only when you genuinely need props/styles for the whole tree.
- inspect_component(name) — deep dive into a specific component's props, state, and hooks.

## Tips
- Works on Paper, Fabric, and Bridgeless / new arch.
- Coordinates are screen space: the same space screenshots, get_screen_state and tap() use. Do not convert.`

    {
        id: "layout",
        title: "Layout Debugging",
        summary: "Capture screenshots, verify UI changes, inspect layout frames and styles",
        content: `# Layout Debugging

## Orient First
- get_screen_state — start here after any tap or navigation. Screenshot-free: active route,
  open overlays, and every on-screen element with a tap-ready (x, y) and frame. Reads screen
  content (prices, labels, which image loaded) without a screenshot+OCR round-trip.
  - pressablesOnly=true for just the tappable list.
  - Switches and checkboxes are listed with their current value as [switch:ON] / [switch:OFF].
    They carry no onPress, so tap them by testID or component — never by guessing an x from a
    screenshot, which lands on the neighbouring row about as often as not.
  - Elements under an open overlay or a raised keyboard are grouped separately — taps will
    not reach them until it closes.
  - A LogBox banner is excluded from the listing (it mounts above the app and its own buttons
    would otherwise be the only pressables returned). A note says so when one is up — the
    banner still covers screen, so use logbox({action:"dismiss"}) before trusting edge taps.

## Coordinates
All layout tools, tap() and the screenshots share ONE screen-space coordinate system. A frame
read from get_screen_state, get_screen_layout, measure or inspect_at_point can be passed to
tap(x, y) unchanged. Do not divide by the device pixel ratio.

A raised keyboard covers the bottom of the screen, and a coordinate under it is inspectable but
not tappable. get_screen_state groups those elements separately; get_screen_layout, measure and
inspect_at_point print the same keyboard line, and the latter two say outright when the point or
the component's centre is behind it. Dismiss it first (dismiss_keyboard) or target by testID.

On a screen presented as a modal sheet (presentation:'modal'), UIKit insets the screen from the
top of the window and React Native's measurements do not include that inset. Every one of these
tools now corrects for it — derived from the sheet's own measured height, not assumed — so they
still agree with each other and with a screenshot. get_screen_state names the correction and its
size in a note when it applies.

## Verify UI Changes
1. ios_screenshot / android_screenshot — capture current screen
2. Compare visually against expected result or Figma design
3. If an issue is spotted, drill down with inspection tools

## Inspect at a Point
- inspect_at_point(x, y) — identity, frame per ancestor, props, style, and source file:line.
  - Pure JS hit test, no overlay flicker — safe for rapid calls or before/after comparisons.
  - Answers both "why is this clipped / what's the actual size?" and "what padding is set here?".
  - Style is the node's own style object, not a merged cascade — walk the returned ancestors when a value isn't on the node itself.

## Full Screen Layout
- get_screen_layout — full layout data for all components
- Use componentsOnly=true to hide host components (View, Text) and see only custom components
- find_components with includeLayout=true for targeted layout info

## Key Tools
- get_screen_state: route + overlays + every element, screenshot-free (start here)
- ios_screenshot / android_screenshot: visual capture
- tap: also returns a post-tap screenshot by default (no separate screenshot call needed after tapping)
- ocr_screenshot: screenshot with text recognition and tap coordinates
- inspect_at_point: frames per ancestor + props + source file:line (no overlay, fast)`

        id: "interact",
        title: "Device Interaction",
        summary: "Tap buttons, swipe, pinch to zoom, type text, and navigate the app UI",
        content: `# Device Interaction

## Prerequisites
iOS interaction tools (tap, ios_button) require a UI driver:
- Default: AXe — brew install cameroncooke/axe/axe
- Alternative: IDB — brew install idb-companion (set IOS_DRIVER=idb in MCP server env to use it)
Without a UI driver installed, these tools will fail.

## Tapping Elements
Use tap — it tries multiple strategies automatically and returns a post-tap screenshot:
1. tap(testID="login-btn") — most reliable, works via fiber tree (both platforms) and accessibility (Android)
2. tap(text="Login") — text match via fiber tree, then accessibility, then OCR
3. tap(component="IconName") — component name match with parent traversal (for icon-only buttons; use find_components to discover names first)
4. tap(x=..., y=...) — coordinate-based tap from screenshot (last resort)
5. tap(x=..., y=..., native=true) — taps directly via ADB/simctl without React Native connection (for system dialogs, non-RN apps)

tap returns a screenshot after every action (screenshot=true by default) — no need to call ios_screenshot/android_screenshot after tapping.
For coordinate/accessibility/OCR taps, it also verifies if the tap caused a visual change (verify=true by default). Set screenshot=false for fastest execution.

## Long Press
Pass duration (milliseconds) to hold the touch instead of releasing it: tap(testID="row-3", duration=800). Use it for context menus, drag starts and multi-select. React Native fires onLongPress at 500ms, so anything under 500 will not trigger it; 800 is a safe default. Works on both platforms and with every targeting strategy (testID, text, component, coordinates).

The response carries longPress.handlerFound:
- true — the element really has an onLongPress handler (only the fiber strategy can see this)
- false — the hold was delivered, but this element has no onLongPress, so React Native fired its onPress on release instead. The call still succeeds; the warning tells you the long-press action is not wired to this element
- null — resolved by accessibility, OCR or coordinates, which cannot see handlers. Not "no handler", just not knowable from that strategy

Elements wired ONLY for long press (onLongPress with no onPress) are invisible to an ordinary tap by design — a short press on them does nothing. Passing duration is what makes them resolvable.

android_long_press still exists for coordinate holds on Android with no React Native connection; anything reachable through RN should use tap(duration=...).

## Switches and Checkboxes
A Switch has no onPress — its state lives in a value prop — so it used to be unreachable except
by guessing coordinates off a screenshot. tap resolves one like anything else:
tap(testID="notifications-switch") or tap(component="Switch", index=N). get_screen_state lists
every switch with its current value, so you know which one you are about to flip.

The response carries switch.before / switch.after / switch.changed, read back off the element
after the gesture. Read it. A pixel diff reports meaningful:true with the same ~0.4% change rate
whether you flipped the right row or the one above it, so the value is the only signal that tells
those apart. changed:false with a warning means the gesture landed but the value did not move —
a disabled switch, a controlled one whose parent rejected the change, or a miss.

## Pinch to Zoom (Android emulator only — iOS in progress)
pinch sends REAL two-finger touch events through the Android emulator's multi-touch bridge, so it drives anything on screen — React Native, native views, WebViews, maps:
1. pinch(direction="out") — fingers spread apart, zooms IN at screen centre
2. pinch(direction="in") — fingers converge, zooms OUT
3. pinch(direction="out", x=..., y=...) — zoom pivots on that point (screenshot pixels, same space as tap and get_screen_state)
4. pinch(direction="out", scale=8) — bigger ratio; values too large for one gesture chain automatically
5. pinch(angle=90) — fingers on the vertical axis instead of horizontal
6. pinch(durationMs=...) — slow the gesture down when a surface ignores a fast pinch

Read verification.meaningful, exactly like swipe: false means nothing zoomed (surface is not zoomable, already at a zoom limit, or the focal point missed it).

### Controlling the gesture's footprint with span
span is the fraction of the available screen the gesture occupies. It defaults to 1 for direction="out" and 0.5 for direction="in", because a pinch-in STARTS with the fingers far apart — a full span would land its contacts at the screen extremes, where a top bar or a bottom sheet takes the gesture before the zoomable surface sees it. Lower span further if a gesture still lands on surrounding UI; raise it to zoom out further in one gesture. It does not change the zoom ratio (that is scale).

### Platform support
Android emulators only. Physical Android devices have no gRPC bridge, and iOS needs a multi-touch HID helper that no released idb ships — both return an explicit error rather than a partial result. pinch never fakes a zoom by calling app code: success means real fingers moved.

## Best Practice: Use testID
Set testID on all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, links) for reliable tapping:
- More stable than text matching — doesn't break with translations or UI text changes
- Exact match — no ambiguity when multiple elements share similar text
- Works across fiber (iOS + Android) and accessibility (Android via resource-id)
- Also enables TextInput focusing: tap(testID="email-input") finds inputs via fiber

## TextInput Fields
tap detects TextInput elements (onChangeText/onFocus) in the fiber tree and falls through to native tap (accessibility or coordinates) for actual focus. This means tap(testID="email-input") works even though inputs don't have onPress.

### Replacing pre-filled values (Bridgeless/Fabric only)
Inputs that already contain text are the most common verification-blocker. The typing tools APPEND by default — typing "https://app.example.com" into a field that already holds "https://demo.example.com" produces "https://demo.example.comhttps://app.example.com", not the intended replacement. Two tools handle this on Bridgeless/Fabric apps:

- **input_text with replace:true** — clear the focused field, then type, in a single call. This is the way to set a pre-filled field to an exact value. Works both by target (testID/component/textMatch) and, with native:true, on whatever already has focus.
- **dismiss_keyboard** — blur the currently focused TextInput, closing the on-screen keyboard. Useful before tapping buttons hidden behind the keyboard, or to verify "tap outside dismisses" behavior.

dismiss_keyboard acts on whatever has focus; input_text focuses its own target unless native:true is passed. replace:true updates React state via onChangeText("") — controlled components (Formik, react-hook-form, useState) stay consistent. Calling publicInstance.clear() directly does NOT do this; it only updates the native side and leaves form state stale.

Multi-device sessions: pass device="<rn-device-name>" (substring match) to disambiguate when replace:true is used. Single-device sessions can omit.

### Reading the result — the field transforms text, and that is not a failure
input_text reads the field back and compares. Several differences are the FIELD doing its job, and are reported as verified rather than as a mismatch:
- autoCapitalize (RN defaults to "sentences", so "abc" lands as "Abc"), autocorrect respacing, and a formatted/decorated value.
- maxLength: a full field truncates every attempt identically, so this is named as the cause instead of being retried — retrying would clear the field and type the same truncated text again. A one-character-per-box OTP input needs one call per box.
- A masked field (secureTextEntry / android:password) exposes bullets, never its text. The write is reported as DELIVERED BUT NOT VERIFIED — that is the ceiling, not a bug, and no read-back can lift it. replace:true still clears first, since "it looked empty" is not evidence that it was.
- A value that gained formatting ("5551234567" -> "(555) 123-4567") is either a display mask (the write landed) or a field reinterpreting the number ("3700" -> "37.00", a different value). The text alone cannot tell these apart, so read the app's own state to decide.
- keyboardType: both write paths bypass the on-screen keyboard, so letters do reach a number-pad field. The write is allowed and noted — a test that passes only because the harness typed the untypeable is worth knowing about.
- native:true types into whatever the OS reports as FOCUSED, which a fiber tap on a TextInput does not necessarily move. The verdict names the field it wrote, so a mis-target reads as one instead of as a wrong value.

## Icon-Only Buttons
For buttons that contain only an icon (no text):
- tap(component="CartIcon") — finds the icon and walks up the fiber tree to press the nearest pressable parent
- Use maxTraversalDepth to increase parent search depth (default: 15) for deeply wrapped components

## Non-ASCII Text (Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic)
tap(text=...) skips fiber for non-ASCII (Hermes limitation) and uses accessibility/OCR instead. For best results, use testID or coordinates.

## Other Interactions
- swipe: cross-platform swipe/scroll. Easiest form: swipe({ direction: "up" }) scrolls to reveal more content (content-scroll semantics; "down"/"left"/"right" supported, bare swipe() defaults to "up"). Optional distance is in screenshot pixels (default 33% of the axis). For pixel-precise gestures pass all four startX/startY/endX/endY coordinates — they take precedence over direction. Use for FlatList/SectionList scrolling where off-screen items aren't mounted. Returns verification.meaningful — if false, warning names which no-op it was, by probing the scroll surface under the start point: already at top, already at end, content not scrollable, wrong axis, or no scroll view there at all. On a screen with no React Native connection it says it could not inspect the screen, rather than claiming the gesture missed — the gesture itself still went through, and swipe needs no RN connection to drive the device. Set burst:true to surface overscroll/bounce feedback even when the final state is unchanged. Set verify:false, screenshot:false for the fastest path. Pass delta on iOS to control touch step size.
- input_text: type text — target with testID/component/textMatch (focuses itself), or pass native:true to type into whatever already has focus (system dialogs, non-RN screens). Pass replace:true to clear pre-filled values before typing (Bridgeless/Fabric only).
- dismiss_keyboard: blur the focused input, closing the keyboard.
- ios_button / android_key_event: hardware buttons (HOME, BACK, etc.)
- ios_open_url: deep links and universal links

## After Interactions

        id: "logs",
        title: "Debug Logs",
        summary: "Read console logs, errors, and warnings from the running app",
        content: `# Debug Logs

## Workflow
1. get_logs with summary=true — get counts by level and last 5 messages (overview first)
2. Based on what you see:
   - get_logs with level="error" — errors only
   - search_logs with text="..." — find specific messages
   - get_logs with verbose=true and maxLogs=10 — full details for recent entries
3. clear_logs — reset buffer, then re-capture after a specific action

## Key Tools
- get_logs: retrieve logs with filtering (level, maxLogs, summary, verbose, startFromText)
- search_logs: text search across all captured logs
- clear_logs: reset the log buffer

## NATIVE LOGS (crashes the JS console cannot see)

get_logs(source="native") reads Android logcat / iOS os_log, filtered to your
app, and returns one row per EVENT rather than per line — a 60-line backtrace
collapses to a single row.

  get_logs(source="native")            recent native events (>= warn)
  get_logs(source="native", kind="crash")   crashes and nothing else
  get_log_details(id="n7")             the full backtrace for one event
  get_logs(source="all")               native + JS merged

WHEN NATIVE BEATS JS: if the app dies before JS runs — a missing .so, a JNI
abort, a Java exception in MainApplication — CDP never connects and get_logs()
returns nothing. The crash is in the native log the whole time. You do not
normally need to ask: when the JS buffer is empty and the app is disconnected,
get_logs() consults native crash events automatically.

COST: native reads shell out to the device (~1-1.5s per device), so source="js"
stays the default. minLevel defaults to "warn"; crashes and ANRs are returned
regardless of it.

FLOOR: minLevel is ordered debug < log < info < warn < error < fatal. On iOS reach
for "log" — os_log "Default", the tier a plain os_log() call emits and most of what
a simulator produces, sits there, so "info" excludes it. When a floor hides every
event the read says so and names the floor to retry with, rather than returning a
bare "No log events."

LIMITS: iOS Simulator and Android emulator/device only (physical iOS devices are not
supported). Event ids stay valid until that device's buffer rolls over or clear_logs
runs — if get_log_details reports an unknown id, call get_logs again to refresh them.

## Tips
- Always start with summary=true to avoid token overload
- Use verbose=true with low maxLogs for full error details
- Use startFromText to begin reading from a specific point

    {
        id: "network",
        title: "Network Inspection",
        summary: "Debug API calls, check request/response data, find failed requests",
        content: `# Network Inspection

## Important: Network Capture Limitations

Network capture works differently depending on your React Native architecture:

**Without SDK (basic mode):**
- Works best on RN 0.73-0.75 (Hermes + Bridge) via CDP Network domain
- On Bridgeless targets (Expo SDK 52+, RN 0.76+), uses a JS fetch interceptor as fallback — may miss early startup requests (auth, config, initial API calls)
- Does NOT capture request/response bodies or full headers
- Some architecture combinations may not capture network data at all

**With SDK (recommended for network debugging):**
- Install: npm install execbro-sdk
- Captures ALL requests from app startup including auth flows and token refresh
- Full request/response headers and bodies (including GraphQL queries and responses)
- Works reliably on all RN architectures

If network tools return no data or you need startup requests, recommend the SDK to the user.

## Workflow
1. get_network_requests with summary=true — overview of all requests
2. Filter by what you need:
   - get_network_requests with urlPattern, method, or status filters
   - search_network with urlPattern for text search
3. get_request_details with requestId — headers, body, timing for one request
   - The first call returns the body's SHAPE (key paths, array sizes), not the whole thing
   - Then narrow: get_request_details({requestId, query:"data.orders[0].status"})
   - A query renders ONLY the queried body — no headers, no other side. Pass
     include:"request" | "response" | "both" when you want the rest
   - Authorization, Cookie and api-key headers print as scheme + length. verbose:true
     shows the value — it also puts a live token in the transcript, so only when you
     actually need to compare it
4. clear_network — reset buffer, then re-capture

## Changing what the network returns
1. network_mock({action:"add", url:"/orders", status:500}) — canned response
2. network_mock({action:"add", url:"/me", mode:"tamper", remove:["data.email"]}) — mutate the real one
3. network_condition({mode:"offline"}) — fail everything; also patches NetInfo when installed
4. Reproduce, then get_network_requests — mocked rows are tagged [MOCK m1]
5. network_mock({action:"clear"}) when done — rules survive reload_app

Mock rules are the way to reach an error branch through the app's real code.
redux_dispatch writes the post-failure state directly and skips the code you
are trying to fix.

network_replay({requestId}) re-issues a captured request, optionally with a
changed body or header, without driving the UI back to the screen that made it.

## Key Tools
- get_network_requests: list requests with filters (urlPattern, method, status, summary)
- search_network: search by URL pattern
- get_request_details: one request's headers, body, timing. Shape first, then query="dotted.path" to pull a field in full. With SDK installed, includes full request/response bodies.
- clear_network: reset the request buffer
- network_mock: replace or tamper with responses (add / list / remove / clear)
- network_condition: offline / slow / normal
- network_replay: re-issue a captured request, with optional overrides

## Tips
- Start with summary=true to see the request landscape
- Narrow with query, not verbose: on a GraphQL response verbose is the 40KB dump query exists to avoid, and it re-prints the bearer token on every call
- A query costs a few hundred characters because it drops the other side and the headers; add include:"both" only when you need them
- If no network data appears, the app may be on a Bridgeless target — suggest installing the SDK
- With SDK: response bodies show full GraphQL responses, useful for debugging data issues
- Mock rules are per-device and survive reload_app. Every network read carries a banner while any rule is active — clear them when done, or the next investigation starts against altered traffic
- network_mock({action:"list"}) shows hit counts. Matching is first-rule-wins, so a rule with hits=0 is usually shadowed by a broader one above it
- Mocking only covers JS-originated HTTP. Native-module traffic (native SDKs, <Image> loading) goes around it`

        id: "state",
        title: "App State",
        summary: "Inspect Redux store, global variables, and execute JavaScript in the app",
        content: `# App State

## Workflow
1. list_debug_globals — discover what's exposed (Redux store, navigation refs, action creators). If the SDK is installed, the response includes an \`sdk.paths\` array of ready-to-use dotted paths.
2. inspect_global with objectName — see properties and methods before calling them. Accepts identifiers AND dotted paths (e.g. \`__RN_AI_DEVTOOLS__.stores.redux\`).
3. execute_in_app — run JavaScript expressions in the app context

## SDK Integration (execbro-sdk, formerly react-native-ai-devtools-sdk)
If the app called \`init({ stores, navigation, custom })\`, prefer the SDK paths over scattered globals:
- Inspect a registered store: inspect_global("__RN_AI_DEVTOOLS__.stores.redux")
- Inspect navigation ref: inspect_global("__RN_AI_DEVTOOLS__.navigation")
- Inspect a custom object (e.g. mmkv, api client): inspect_global("__RN_AI_DEVTOOLS__.custom.mmkv")
- Read state: execute_in_app("__RN_AI_DEVTOOLS__.stores.redux.getState().sliceName")

## Redux
- redux_get_state({path:"cart"}) — read a slice, resolved through the app's <Provider> store
- redux_dispatch({action:{type:"app/setIsLoading",payload:true}}) — dispatch through that same store, so useSelector subscribers re-render
- redux_dispatch({action:[a, b, c], returnPath:"settings"}) — an ARRAY dispatches in order in ONE round trip. Restoring a settings slice is one call, not one per field
- To reach an error branch, mock the response instead — redux_dispatch writes the post-failure state directly and skips the request builder, the error branch and the retry

## Common Patterns (no SDK)
- Read Redux: execute_in_app("globalThis.__REDUX_STORE__.getState().sliceName")
- Dispatch action: execute_in_app("globalThis.__dispatch__(globalThis.__REDUX_ACTIONS__.slice.action(args))")
- Navigate: execute_in_app("globalThis.__navigate__('ScreenName')")
- Current route: execute_in_app("globalThis.__getCurrentRoute__()")

## Long-Running Expressions
- Pass timeoutMs to raise the 10s default (capped at 120000) — the promise poll ladder is derived from it, so a big budget is actually used
- A promise that outlives the budget is kept in the app and its handle returned: execute_in_app({collect:"<handle>", waitMs:30000}) blocks server-side until it settles instead of making you poll

## Hermes Limitations
- NO require() or import — only pre-existing globals
- NO async/await — use simple expressions or .then() chains
- NO emoji or non-ASCII in string literals
- Use globalThis instead of global

## Tips
- Always inspect_global before calling methods on unfamiliar objects
- Use verbose=true with caution — Redux stores can return 10KB+
- Set higher maxResultLength when default 2000 chars isn't enough`

        summary: "Check Metro bundler status, fix compilation errors, reload the app",
        content: `# Bundle Health

## Workflow
1. get_bundle_status — check if Metro is running and its build state
2. get_bundle_errors — check for compilation/bundling errors
3. Fix errors in code
4. get_bundle_errors({ clear: true }) — read, then reset the error buffer
5. reload_app — trigger full JS bundle reload (only if needed)

## When to Reload
React Native has Fast Refresh by default. Only reload_app when:
- Changes aren't appearing after a few seconds
- App is in a broken/error state
- Need to reset full app state (navigation, context)
- Made changes to native code or config files

## Red Screen Errors
If no errors captured via CDP, use get_bundle_errors with platform="ios" or "android" — this triggers screenshot+OCR fallback to read errors from the device screen.

## Key Tools
- get_bundle_status: Metro health check
- get_bundle_errors: compilation errors
- reload_app: full JS bundle reload
- ensure_connection: verify connection with healthCheck=true`

## How It Works
1. Call send_feedback with a type (feedback, feature_request, or bug), title, and description
2. The tool auto-collects environment info (server version, platform, device, license)
3. It returns a pre-filled GitHub issue URL and a formatted issue body
4. Ask the user to open the URL and paste the body to submit

## Parameters
- type: "feedback", "feature_request", or "bug"
- title: short summary (becomes the GitHub issue title)
- description: detailed explanation
- workflow_context (optional): what the user was trying to do

## End-of-Session Experience Report
At the end of a session, you can self-report your experience using the tools — this is some of the most valuable feedback we get. When asked (or proactively when a session wrapped up with notable friction):
1. Write a report covering where the ExecBro tools made you struggle and what about them could be improved — which tool, what you expected, what happened. Keep it about the tools, not the app you were debugging. Save it as a Markdown file for the user.
2. Call send_feedback with type "feedback", a short title, and the report as the description (set workflow_context to which ExecBro tools / steps were involved). This turns the report into a pre-filled GitHub issue URL.
3. Give the user the returned URL and ask them to open and submit it.

Saving the Markdown file alone does NOT reach the team — you must call send_feedback to generate the GitHub issue.

Suggested prompt the user can paste to trigger this:
> Write a report about your experience with the ExecBro tools specifically — which tools made the debugging work harder, what you expected vs. what happened, and what could be improved. Don't summarize the app feature we worked on; focus on the tools. Save it as a Markdown file for me, then submit it using the send_feedback tool (type "feedback") so it becomes a GitHub issue.

## Tips
- Include workflow_context when possible — name the ExecBro tools/steps in play so the team can reproduce the tooling issue
- The user can review and edit the issue body before submitting
- No GitHub account setup or CLI tools needed — just a browser`
