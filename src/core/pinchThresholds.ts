 * were recognised as a pinch under BOTH three-button and gesture navigation,
 * and the focused window never changed. Android's back-gesture handler bails
 * as soon as a second pointer is down, and both of ours land in the same
 * frame. 4px is only to keep rounded coordinates on screen.
 *
 * TOP/BOTTOM — MEASURED as NOT safe, which a first round of measurement
 * missed. The status and navigation bars are separate windows, not gesture
 * zones: a contact that goes DOWN inside one is delivered to SystemUI and the
 * app never sees it. A vertical pinch whose first contact landed at y=4
 * pulled the notification shade down instead of zooming. The initial vertical
 * experiment only tested pinch-OUT, whose contacts land near the centre, so
 * it never put a touch-down in the status bar.
 *
 * 220/200 covers the Pixel 9 emulator's measured need (a contact had to start
 * below y=176 to reach the app, against a 142px status bar) with headroom.
