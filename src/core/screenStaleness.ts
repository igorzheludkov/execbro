/**
 * Did the screen move under the agent, or did the agent aim at the wrong thing?
 *
 * `tap` and `input_text` both fail with a targeting miss — "no element found",
 * "no TextInput matched that target" — and those two words cover three
 * completely different situations that the error message cannot tell apart:
 *
 *   1. The agent named something that was never on this screen. Its plan was
 *      wrong, or its model of the screen was stale by its own doing.
 *   2. The screen changed underneath it. A person is driving the simulator in
 *      parallel — they scrolled, dismissed the keyboard, unfocused the field,
 *      or navigated away between the agent forming its plan and the call
 *      landing. Nothing about the tool is broken.
 *   3. Everything was there and the matcher still said no. This is the only
 *      one that is a bug in us.
 *
 * All three land in `validation` today, which is why a 25.8% input_text failure
 * rate on 2.8.1 says nothing about whether input_text works. Separating them is
 * the same argument that gave `driver_missing` its own bucket for tap: a
 * failure the tool could not have prevented must not be counted against it,
 * but must still be visible when it spikes.
 *
 * The discriminator is a comparison, not a measurement. We remember what the
 * agent was last shown on a device and compare it with what is there now.
